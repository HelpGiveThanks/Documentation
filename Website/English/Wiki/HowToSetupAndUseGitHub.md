To start using GitHub you just need a GitHub account, but there are some privacy and ownership issues that can be better addressed, and some fun to be had, if you consider first setting up Gmail and Gravatar accounts to use just with your GitHub account:

**Gmail**

1. https://accounts.google.com/SignUp

**ActionLog**

1. Copy most recent commit number from https://github.com/HelpGiveThanks/ActionLog
2. Copy your improved ActionLog file.
3. Paste it into your local GitHub ActionLog repository ActionLog sub folder.  The ActionLog consists of three related databases each with their own folder in the main ActionLog repository folder: ActionLog, MyData, Reference. 
4. Replace file name with copied, most-recent commit number (only need first part of number for identification purposes). 
5. Compress/Zip file.
6. Delete uncompressed file.
7. Go to GitHub App and type reason for new FileMaker file including the full, copied, commit number.
8. Commit new file.
9. Sync commit.
10. Go to GitHub on the web to confirm commit. 
  
**Other Solutions: Help, HeartWhisperer, Budget Planner, IQ Raiser**  
At this time, I have not created an import script and process for these solutions, which like the Library are one database containing both layouts, scripts, and user data.  So, if you improve them, please do what you can to reduce their file size such as removing user data if it will help, compress/zip them, and delete the unzipped file before making your commit.
