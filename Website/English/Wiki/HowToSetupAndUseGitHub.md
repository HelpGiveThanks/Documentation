To start using GitHub you just need a GitHub account, but there are some privacy and ownership issues that can be better addressed, and some fun to be had, if you consider first setting up Gmail and Gravatar accounts to use just with your GitHub account:

1. Open your fork on GitHub.
2. Click on "Pull Requests".
3. Click on "New Pull Request". By default, GitHub will compare the original with your fork, and there shouldn't be anything to compare if you didn't make any changes.
4. Click on "switching the base". Now GitHub will compare your fork with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
5. Click on "Click to create a pull request for this comparison" and assign a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., "Update from original").
6. Click on "Send pull request".
7. Scroll down and click "Merge pull request" and finally "Confirm merge". If your fork didn't have any changes, you will be able to merge it automatically.
