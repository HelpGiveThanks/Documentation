Capture the trade-off between searching and knowing, between in general knowing something is in place versus know exactly where something is, can be made by frequency of use measurement taking into account how much time we use in a year finding something, which if we use it infrequently, the time spent searching for it in a box where we know it is, is fine, but when we use daily, then we need to know exactly where it is.

Also need to think about dividing storage of house up into frequent and infrequent use storage areas, so easy to get to areas space is known vs. difficult to get to spaces.
