=== Introduction ===
Welcome to the Help Give Thanks Research Project by David Matson for testing Walter Freeman’s brain research, Daniel Gilbert’s happiness research, and the research of Paul Cisek, Robert Lustig, Jeffrey Schwartz, Edward Tufte, Willem Vanderburg, Margaret Visser, and more.  The Imagine Quality Management library is filled with over 1000 links to their and others’ research papers, talks, etc.  

We cannot know the world by direct experience of it. ... [N]eurodynamicists have proven experimentally that [solipsism] is true. Cognitive scientists have also proved that it is true [like Paul Cisek].  ... If everything each of us knows is made inside our brains, how can we know the same things? The answer is simple. We share almost the same things. Almost. ... No one can truly feel what another person is feeling, though we can empathize through shared experience. This separation has a good side, in that each of us has the inalienable right to privacy. The bad side is loneliness. And here, paradoxically, is where joy begins to enter.

... Where we humans find joy is in surmounting this solipsistic barrier between us and sharing our feelings and comforts. We cannot ever really cross it, but, a bit like neighbors chatting over a fence, we can be together. However, there is more to this communion than mere talking. There is trust, which underlies true friendships and partnerships. ... Trust comes when we are able to predict what other people will do, and we achieve that by repeated cooperative actions.  

Aristotle wrote: "Happiness is activity of the soul in accordance with virtue." That is rather abstract. We can see virtue as a set of shared goals for the good of ourselves and our children. Joy comes with activities that we share with people we have learned to trust, and that enable us to share meaning across the solipsistic barrier that separates each of us from all others.
