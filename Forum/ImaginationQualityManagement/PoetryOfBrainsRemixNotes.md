Preview of Ideas 

1. Brains are illogical.
2. All we know is an illusion created by our brains.     <br>
Sensing (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, etc.) is     <br>
impossible.The idea of neural representation,     <br>
stimulus/response, input/output, etc. is false.
3. Our illusion of reality is updated as we move our     <br>
bodies, provoking responses from reality that     <br>
impact our senses, which then pass/fails the     <br>
current illusion, causing the brain to keep it,     <br>
update it, or create a new one = learn.     <br>
4. To share experiences is impossible, but if we     <br>
move, test, act together we can force our brains to     <br>
create similar illusions of reality that feel like     <br>
shared experiences, and help us to create trust.     <br>

Brains are not logical.     <br> <br>

Brain activity is not like binary digits     <br>
that can be rendered into logic gates     <br>
and Boolean algebra (algebraic notation     <br>
for representing logical propositions).     <br>

Brain activity is instead rather     <br>
wicked looking, noisy, and trashy.     <br> <br>

00.39.04     <br>

<br><hr><br>

Brains are dynamic systems that learn by testing,     <br>
acting, moving their bodies, etc.,     <br>
which Dr. Freeman will illustrate     <br>
in the next two examples.     <br> <br>

The first example comes from the work of     <br>
Jean Pierre Flourens (1794-1867)     <br>
French physiologist, founder of experimental     <br>
brain science, discoverer of chloroform anesthesia,     <br>
and more ...     <br> <br>

people Dr. Freeman gives credit to during his talk.*     <br> <br>

Hans-Lukas Teuber (1916-1977)     <br>
from MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology     <br>
Head of the Department of Psychology (1961-1977)     <br> <br>

00.39.04     <br>

<br><hr><br>

Professor Teuber spoke about     <br>
his upside-down, prism-glasses experiment at     <br>
a symposium held in Poland in 1971:     <br> <br>

"In fact in one version of the basic experiment, two     <br> 
men are exposed to a normal environment wearing     <br>
identical prismatic spectacles; one walks actively     <br>
about while pushing the other over the same path     <br>
in a wheelchair. At the end of the hour the active     <br>
observer has almost fully adapted [functions normally],     <br>
whereas the passive observer has not adapted at all."     <br> <br>

Teuber, Hans-Lukas. "Unity and diversity of frontal lobe     <br>
functions." Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis (The     <br>
Polish neuroscience quarterly) 32.2 (1972): 615-656.     <br>
Retrieved 4/8/13 from ane.pl/pdf/3236.pdf     <br>

<br><hr><br>

The cortex of Professor Teuber's star student     <br>
learned to adapt to quick flips of the prism glasses,     <br>
allowing him to predict Cambridge traffic flipped     <br>
upside-down, right-side-up, upside-down, etc. as he     <br>
drove thru this traffic on a speeding motorcycle!     <br>

<br><hr><br>

Brains learn by predicting what is going to happen     <br>
as a result of their own actions, actions that provoke     <br>
sensory input to pass/fail said predictions = learning.     <br> <br>

1) Brains imagine/predict the results of an action.     <br>
2) Brains make the body act to test a prediction.     <br>
3) Sensory information pass/fails the prediction.     <br>
4) Brains learn by continually cycling thru steps 1- 3.     <br> <br>

The reverse stimulus/response cycle is false:     <br>
1) Sense information. 2) Learn. 3) Respond/React to it.     <br> <br>

Those (active) pushing the wheelchairs learned,     <br>
while the (passive) pushed did not learn anything.     <br> <br>

Predict/Imagine > Act/Test > Sense > Learn!     <br>
NOT Sense > Learn > React     <br> <br>

00.39.04     <br>

<br><hr><br>

Sensory Substitution     <br> <br>

The brains of the wheelchair-pushed participants failed     <br>
to adapt to an upside-down world. For example, passive-     <br>
prism-glass wearers’ know logically that dropped balls fall     <br>
down, but their unadapted brains predict that dropped     <br>
balls go up in an upside-down world, and so when first     <br>
allowed to become active, to test, these individuals with     <br>
unadapted brains will reach up to catch dropped balls.     <br> <br>

Brains are not logical, and use the senses <u>not to inform     <br>
themselves,</u> but to test their imaginings/predictions/etc.     <br> <br>

Given that our brains <u>only use our senses</u> to pass/fail     <br>
imagined experiences during active tests, we can make     <br>
the scientific prediction that brains do not need     <br>
eyes to see, ears to hear, etc.!     <br> <br>

00.55.48     <br>

<br><hr><br>

Sensory Substitution Theory Brains use sensory organs to test their imagined ideas of the world, not to sense (to see, hear, feel, etc.) the world,
and, so, are able to use one sense to do the job of another.
Sensory Substitution Use — Substitute a sense that is not working for one that is = see with your ears!
1) Capture information that the lost sense evolved to detect with artificial sensors like cameras, for example. 2) Use a computer to translate the camera’s
information into patterns that the substituted sensory organ can detect: patterns of sound. 3) Allow the brain to test (pass/fail) its predicted
patterns of imagined visual experience, against real patterns of light translated into patterns of sound.
Dr. Freeman will now give an example of how brains learn to imagine the experience of balance and test it against felt patterns of information
supplied to the tongue by digital balance sensors, instead of disease damaged vestibular systems (balance sensory systems) located in the inner ears.

Brains can learn to substitute information coming from the eyes, ears, vestibular (balance) system, etc.
for patterns of tactile/felt information coming from, for example, a wafer on the tongue fed information
by a computer hooked up to cameras, microphones, accelerometers (balance sensors), etc.

00.55.48
Brains only create meaning if the stimulus (information) coming into the senses is significant (rewarding, dangerous, etc.) to the organism (human, rabbit, mouse, etc.).
One of the most important things that brains do is screen out MOST of the information coming into the senses. Information that is of no significance to the animal.

The information/scents coming into the nose cannot be responsible for the patterns/ meanings generated by the brain, otherwise as with the symbols for (spelling of) ‘banana’ and ‘air’, the brain patterns too should have remained static when the association of a reward (green) was
switched to air scents.
Banana

The fact that the patterns did not remain static disproves the idea that information/scents coming into the nose are responsible for the patterns/meanings
generated by the brain.
In other words ...
If these patterns are caused to come into being because a rabbit
smells banana or air, if they are the representations for these smells, then they
should never change. Like the spellings of words, they should always be the same no matter what they
are associated with: reward, nothing, etc.
Banana	Air

These patterns did change after the reward switch, thus disproving the theory that brain patterns observed to be consistently associated with sensory informa- tion are representations
of sensory (smelled, seen, heard, etc.) information.

The whole science of neural representation, stimulus/response, input/output, etc. is disproven
by the evidence of neural dynamics.
01.10.33
All that brains can know is what they hypothesize and through testing determine useful-to-the-organism hypotheses, meanings, imaginings, etc.
The action-perception theory replaces the stimulus-response theory as the evidence from neural dynamics shows that brains create behavior in response to their own
hypotheses, meanings, imaginings, etc.
Brains do not respond to stimuli coming from reality.
Brains are solipsistic.
01.10.33
Does a test based on the brain’s imagination (hypothesis) of reality fail or not fail when tested?
The results of such tests are ALL that any brain can know about the usefulness of its
imaginings, created meanings, self-generated hypothesis, etc.
ALL that any brain knows is what it has created within itself, and how well its creations have tested.
01:12:49
Brains are continually engaged in 1) predicting the future (creating hypotheses), 2) testing their predictions to determine their reliability to successfully guide behavior toward reward, away from danger, etc., and then 3) changing their predictions (hypotheses) as required by the results of their tests.
The action-perception theory is replacing the stimulus-response theory as science experiments show that brains create behavior (actions) to test their own hypotheses (meanings), not to respond to information coming into the senses from reality.
01:14:30
John von Neumann (1903–1957) University of Berlin Princeton University Institute for Advanced Study Site Y, Los Alamos
Brains are dynamical systems that do not use a language of any kind.
01.33.19
Brains’ dynamic systems (sometimes called chaotic systems) give rise to speech (like Dr. Freeman’s), and text (like this text) without using a language of any kind to create them
or to understand them.
‘Language’ in this sense is not really a thing at all, but rather a set of relationships among a 1) dynamic system = brain, 2) behavior = speech and writing, 3) artifacts = speech sounds and texts, and 4) senses = eyes, ears, etc. By continually cycling thru this set of relationships (aka language), the brain tests and refines its ability to
produce useful language artifacts.	01:33:19
Plato (428 – 348 BC) Greek Philosopher, Student of Socrates, etc.
Aristotle (384 – 322 BC) Greek Philosopher, Student of Plato, etc.
Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) Italian philosopher,Theologian, and Dominican Friar
The light of meaning comes from within, illuminating the fabric of Aquinas's tent. Brains create ideas, hypothesis, imaginings, etc.
We push this fabric out against objects in the world.
Brains create behaviors to provoke sensory input.
The tent’s fabric conforms around these objects.
Sensory input pass/fails brains’ ideas, imaginings, etc.
Thus, we learn what these objects might look like if the impenetrable barrier of the tent, the solipsistic isolation of our brains,
did not separate the fabric encased shapes,
did not separate the imagined objects, people, etc,
from the actual objects, people, etc. outside the tent,
from actual objects, people, etc. in reality.	01:36:18
Brains are intentional creators of meaning, not passive receivers of information.
01.36.18
Jean Piaget (1896 - 1980) Swiss Developmental Psychologist and Philosopher
The light of meaning comes from within, 1) creating an array of attractors predictions/hypotheses/meanings which the brain
2) tests by provoking a response from reality, an action which results in 3) energy impacting our senses, and then 4) hitting one of these attractors, and causing possibly
an accommodation/change to the attractor or not. This prediction, action, perception, accommodation cycle builds our knowledge of what is outside the
impenetrable barrier separating our attractors, the brain’s meanings, from the energy impacting our senses,
reality’s information.
01:38:00
We know only by imagining and doing what we imagine is right, not by experiencing and responding to what is real.
We are essentially insane: [inˈsān] – in a state of mind (in a tent with impenetrable walls) that prevents normal perception.
But everyone is equal in this their inability to experience things as they are, to experience only what they imagine, never what is.
01:38:00
The first layer of cortex in our ears, eyes, skin, etc. puts up attractor landscapes like craters on the Moon. Each attractor (crater) is a prediction of what
patterns of information/energy might hit our senses. When a patten of energy hits, what gets transmitted to the rest of the brain is which attractor/prediction/ meaning/etc. has been hit, not the actual pattern, and not where or how well the patten hit the attractor.
This is easy to see in toddlers, as they have very small attractor landscapes. The image of a cat hits their one attractor for four-legged animals; it spirals to the bottom, and the toddler points, and says, “dog!”
Brains can only experience what they create (dog), not what the senses sense (cat).	1:45:16
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900) German philosopher, poet, composer, cultural critic, etc.
Everyone is equal in their inability to experience things as they are, to experience only what they imagine, never what is. So how do we share knowledge?
We share knowledge when predicting, acting/testing, sensing, and accommodating together, thus causing our brains to generate similar meanings. The more action required in our relating to each other (dancing versus watching TV together) the more similar and useful will grow our meanings, our “shared” knowledge, our imagined experiences of what is real.
01:50:40
Our excess focus on individual achievement is a denial of our brains’ core need to have others actively participate in our lives (act with us)
rather than watch and judge us. We need others to practice with us, not preach at us.
Brains are social organs.
We “share” knowledge ONLY when predicting, acting/testing, sensing, and accommodating together, causing our brains to generate similar meanings. Failure to act together (to preach, but not practice)
isolates us from each other, making us feel apart,
even when we are together.
01:58:45
Brains create new categories/attractors/meanings/etc. in response to A) failures by their existing attractors that B) also demand attention = “Learn this!”
1) An energy pattern failing to fit any existing attractor, 2) falls into a waste-basket attractor, which 3) if the orienting response is also triggered, 4) causes the brain to grow a new attractor = learn, but only if 5) the brain can test the new attractor.
For example, dogs' orienting responses may be triggered for unknown words, "Learn this!" But, unable to test words, to speak, most words heard will never make it out of dogs’ waste-basket attractors.
The inability to push their vocabulary wheelchairs, to speak, limits the size of word-attractor arrays for dogs.
2:00:27
To facilitate new learning you must open up your mind. Perhaps one way to do this is to move in a novel way, and in so doing force your brain into creating new attractors, meanings, predictions, etc. to handle the novel movements that you are asking it to make, and that at first, using its existing attractors, it will fail to do. Repeated practice of the novel movements, will continually create new attractors until the movements are easily handled by the brain. Forcing the brain to focus on new experiences increases the overall plasticity of the brain to learn anything as noted in the book The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge
(2007 New York:Viking, pages 85-87).02.03.27
The difference between learning that A) we already know something and B) we don’t know something, is a cyclical process of repeated, focused failures.
1) Invoke the orienting response to concentrate all available brain power on the 2) predict/imagine > act/test > sense > learn cycle. 3) The object/event/etc. focused upon must continually
overcome capture by any existing attractor, predictions, imaginings put up by the brain. 4) Only after repeated, focused failure cycles to predict/imagine > act/test > sense > learn
will the brain generate a new attractor, prediction, imagining and thus begin to learn something new!
02.03.27
The brain has to orient, focus, and fail to predict a novel stimulus to create a new attractor, hypothesis, category, meaning, etc.
The brains’ of the natives imagined distant ships to be low clouds, because the images of distant ships on their retinas were not rejected by their cloud attractors. But, as the ships got closer, their cloud
attractors did reject the images of ships and crews ... “Hey, those are NOT clouds!”
We don’t see ships or clouds. We imagine them. One way to get our brains to imagine better is to pay closer and closer attention,“...NOT clouds!” to fail how our brains imagine, predict, categorize, etc.
Push/wheel/drive/etc. your wheelchair! 1 02.04.26
Act/Test!
Drive in life’s traffic using your brain’s manufactured experience and figure out ways to test it,
to flip the input coming into your senses, to challenge your balance with novel movements, to pay closer attention, to force your brain to learn, to accommodate, to empathize,
to dance without stepping on other’s toes!
In Dr. Freeman's 1996 *editorial "Happiness Doesn't Come in Bottles: Neuroscientists learn that joy comes through dancing,
not drugs," he writes ...
*available online as of 4/9/13 from sulcus.berkeley.edu/freemanwww/manuscripts/ IE10/97.html
“ Where we humans find joy is in surmounting [the]
solipsistic barrier between us and sharing our feelings and comforts. We cannot ever really cross it, but, a bit like neighbors chatting over a fence, we can be together.
However, there is more to this communion than mere talking.There is trust, which underlies true friendships and partnerships. ...Trust comes when we are able to predict what other people will do, and we achieve that
by repeated cooperative actions. ...We create our own joys, and we feel happiest in learning to trust each other.”
— Walter J Freeman MD
I hope this remix and my notes where helpful to you!
Push these ideas around for yourself. Present them using your words, images, skits, dances, music, etc. They are very strange, but also very humane, which I
learned remixing the original video to create this one!
The YouTube description has links to the full talk, and to more talks and papers by Dr. Freeman and other scientists investigating the ideas presented in this video.
